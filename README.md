# Rock-Paper-Scissors-Initial

This is my Rock, Paper, Scissors project made for the Odin Project's "Foundations" course. It was made from scratch, by myself, without assistance from Youtube tutorials or pre-made code. 

What I struggled with:
This was my first 'real' Javascript program with multiple parts. Looking back. I had a lot of trouble keeping track of variable values within different functions, as well as managing loops for the first time.

What I learned:
ASK FOR HELP. This project marked the first time I entered The Odin Project Discord, one of the best decisions I ever made. My learning accelerated once I could interact with others that were willing to work with me and lead me to the right direction.

Function scope. I never truly understood how important this concept until I realized that the reason I was getting stuck was because I did not understand that variables with the same name could have different variables if declared and called within different scopes. This widened my hold over my understanding of programming in general.

Coding for command line projects and coding for projects with a UI are very different.
